# Star-Wars-Movie-Scripts-Text-Analysis

Star Wars is a popular film franchise that takes place in a galaxy far, far away. This is a collection of script dialogue between characters for the first three movies (episodes 4-6). In this notebook we are going to perform a statistical text analysis on the Star Wars scripts from The Original Trilogy Episodes (IV, V and VI), using wordclouds to show the most frequent words. The input files used for the analysis are avaliable in this repository.
